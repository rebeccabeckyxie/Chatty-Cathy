# Chatty-Cathy ðŸ¤–
Chatty Cathy is a chatbot that can answer your burning questions ðŸ”¥! Inspired by my curious 8-year-old self that bombarded people with questions and a desire to learn deep learning techniques, Chatty Cathy was born.  

Chatty Cathy was trained with an AmbigQA dataset that included intents, patterns, and responses. She uses a Long Short-Term Memory, a type of recurrent neural network to find the category of the userâ€™s question and then chooses a response randomly from a list of potential answers.
